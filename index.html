          <h3>Trust me, I'm an Engineer</h3>
           <p>
           A little while ago now, I graduated as an Engineer. I managed to
           get a job, bought some work pants and some shirts (actually my mum did)
           and embarked on my career. I really had no idea what I was in for and
           have now spent the last 11 years navigating my way through life in the
           real world. I&#39;ve learnt a huge amount from good people and mentors, 
           and surprising just as much from those that weren&#39;t so good. So I thought 
           I&#39;d jot down some of the little gems of knowledge that I&#39;ve collected over 
           the years in the hope that maybe, just maybe, one of these will give you a 
           leg up as you begin your career.
           </p>
          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            Do your homework. Read up on the company from their website and hit 
            up a few investor presentations to get a flavour for the company and
            where they're going. If you know the name of the hiring manager, find
            them on LinkedIn and check out their background (LinkedIn hint - you can
            set your LinkedIn viewing profile to anonymous in the settings so people
            don't get notified when you've checked out their page).

            Body language is very important in an interview. Sit up to the desk,
            no slouching. Be confident. Those that are nervous or not confident 
            will tend to shrink in to the chairs, which has been proven to have 
            the effect of making you feel less confident, bit of a self-fulfilling
            prophecy.  
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Bre prepared for the usual HR questions:
            <ul>
              <li>Tell us about a project that went well and why</li>
              <li>Tell us about a project that didn't go well and why</li>
              <li>Give us an example of where you demonstrated leadership</li>
              <li>Give us an example of where you had to deal with ambiguity </li>
              <li>Give us an example of where you had to deal with conflict</li>
              <li>Tell us why you applied for this role (be prepared for this one - those that pause are really just saying 'because it&#39;s a job')</li>
              <li>What do you like doing outside of study/work?</li>
              <li>Where do you want to be in 5 years?</li>
              <li>What do you like doing?</li>
              <li>What don&#39;t you like doing?</li>
            </ul>
            And then the role specified ones:
            <ul>
              <li>What subjects did you like at college and why </li>
              <li>What subjects didn&#39;t you like at college and </li>
              <li>How would you solve this problem...</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes they'll want you to answer with the hard maths or logic, but predominantly it's the thought process they're after - particularly for grads. If you&#39;re interviewing a senior engineer you want to be able to test them on some hardcore detail, grads you just want to know they have sound problem solving logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Define the problem - make sure you understand what the problem is that they want you to solve. Ask clarifying questions if need be. Don't freak out if you don't know the answer, just work your way through how you would work out the answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talk through the process you'd go through. Things like - gather data, perform research or literature study, ask lots of questions, build models, perform trials, test results, peer review and check data all go down well. Be succinct though, there's nothing worse than a waffler in an interview. If you have to do a technical presentation, ask how long you have - and stick to it. Those that can't stick to a timeframe get a free ticket to making coffees for the rest of their career in my eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonus question. At the end they'll usually ask you if you have any questions. Be prepared with a couple. Ask them more about the role, development pathways, the type of people in the team etc. This always comes across a lot better than the stunned mullet 'nope' that the majority come up with. Remember an interview is also about you getting comfortable with the company and the role - the conversation shouldn't be all one way.
          </p>
          <h4>First Six Months</h4>
          <p>Expect to feel exhausted after a couple of weeks of full time work. Your brain will be running max CPU as you come up the curve. Yes you get your nights and weekends back from the clutches of study, but don't be surprised if you just want to crawl in to bed Friday night.</p>
          <p>Expect frustration! You'll be hit with a ton of acronyms. Every industry has its own jargon and you'll think they're speaking a different language. Write them down and ask someone what they mean later on. You may be surprised that no one else knows either.</p>
          <p>You may feel like you're not contributing or adding value. To do anything you need to ask for help, even using the bloody printer will require a full briefing. And that's OK! Everyone goes through it. When you get frustrated, sit back and jot down all the things you've already learnt that week, or that month and you'll quickly realise that you know stuff! The ramp up in the first 12 months is EPIC!</p>
