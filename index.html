          <p>
            A little while ago now, I graduated as an Engineer. I 
            managed to get a job, bought some work pants and some 
            shirts (actually my mum did) and embarked on my career. 
            I really had no idea what I was in for and have now spent
            the last 11 years navigating my way through life in the 
            real world. I’ve learnt a huge amount from good people and 
            mentors, and surprising just as much from those that weren’t 
            so good. So I thought I’d jot down some of the little gems of 
            knowledge that I’ve collected over the years in the hope that 
            maybe, just maybe, one of these will give you a leg up as
            you begin your career.

        <div>
          <p>
            Do your homework. Read up on the company from their website 
            and hit up a few investor presentations to get a flavour for 
            the company and where they're going. If you know the name of 
            the hiring manager, find them on LinkedIn and check out their
            background (LinkedIn hint - you can set your LinkedIn viewing
            profile to anonymous in the settings so people don't get 
            notified when you've checked out their page).  
          </p>
          <p>
            Body language is very important in an interview. Sit up to the desk,
            no slouching. Be confident. Those that are nervous or not confident 
            will tend to shrink in to the chairs, which has been proven to have
            the effect of making you feel less confident, bit of a 
            self-fulfilling prophecy.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Be prepared for the usual HR questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tell us about a project that went well and why</li>
            <li>Tell us about a project that didn't go well and why</li>
            <li>Give us an example of where you demonstrated leadership</li>
            <li>Give us an example of where you had to deal with ambiguity</li>
            <li>Give us an example of where you had to deal with conflict</li>
            <li>Tell us why you applied for this role (be prepared for this one - those that pause are really just saying 'because it’s a job')</li>
            <li>What do you like doing outside of study/work?</li>
            <li>Where do you want to be in 5 years?</li>
            <li>What do you like doing?</li>
            <li>What don’t you like doing?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>And then the role specific ones:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What subjects did you like at college and why</li>
            <li>What subjects didn't you like at college and why</li>
            <li>How would you solve this problem...</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Sometimes they'll want you to answer with the hard maths or logic,
            but predominantly it's the thought process they're after - particularly
            for grads. If you’re interviewing a senior engineer you want to be 
            able to test them on some hardcore detail, grads you just want to 
            know they have sound problem solving logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Define the problem - make sure you understand what the problem is
            that they want you to solve. Ask clarifying questions if need be. 
            Don't freak out if you don't know the answer, just work your way 
            through how you would work out the answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talk through the process you'd go through. Things like - gather data, 
            perform research or literature study, ask lots of questions, build models,
            perform trials, test results, peer review and check data all go down well.
            Be succinct though, there's nothing worse than a waffler in an interview.
            If you have to do a technical presentation, ask how long you have - and 
            stick to it. Those that can't stick to a time-frame get a free ticket to 
            making coffees for the rest of their career in my eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bonus question. At the end they'll usually ask you if you have any questions.
            Be prepared with a couple. Ask them more about the role, development pathways,
            the type of people in the team etc. This always comes across a lot better 
            than the stunned mullet 'nope' that the majority come up with. Remember an 
            interview is also about you getting comfortable with the company and the role
            - the conversation shouldn't be all one way.

            Expect to feel exhausted after a couple of weeks of full time work. Your brain
            will be running max CPU as you come up the curve. Yes you get your nights and 
            weekends back from the clutches of study, but don't be surprised if you just 
            want to crawl in to bed Friday night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expect frustration! You'll be hit with a ton of acronyms. Every industry has 
            its own jargon and you'll think they're speaking a different language. Write 
            them down and ask someone what they mean later on. You may be surprised that 
            no one else knows either.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may feel like you're not contributing or adding value. To do anything you
            need to ask for help, even using the bloody printer will require a full briefing.
            And that's OK! Everyone goes through it. When you get frustrated, sit back and jot
            down all the things you've already learnt that week, or that month and you'll 
            quickly realise that you know stuff! The ramp up in the first 12 months is EPIC!

          <h3 class="sub-headings">Prioritisation</h3>
          <p>
            The 'I've got too much to do, not enough time and I don't know where to start'
            conversation. Just about every grad that has started in my team has come to 
            me during their first year with a page full of jobs and doesn't know where to start.
            School and Uni mould you in to a mindset of always being able to complete all of the
            work assigned to you in the given timeframe. You will find very quickly that once you
            get up and running, work will come at you quicker than it goes out. That's when you
            need to prioritise! 
          </p>
          <p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmV0gXpXwDU" target="_blank">Big Rocks, Small Rocks</a> </p>
          <p>
            The most efficient and effective people are those that are organised and can 
            prioritise and plan their work.
          </p>
          <p>
           For sizeable projects, create a plan consisting of key dates, tasks and key milestones
           - most commonly presented as a Gantt chart. It’s particularly important when you are
           working on medium to long term projects so you can focus on short term deliverables
           and ensure you are on track for the long term goal. You’ll hear people refer to short
           interval control – effectively just managing people to short term deliverables to keep
           longer term goals on track. 
          </p>
          <p>
            How you stay organised is really a personal thing, try a few things and find what 
            works for you. I’ve tried everything from OneNote action lists, diaries, notepads, 
            Outlook to iPhone apps. Electronic reminders and future To Do notes in diaries have 
            actually been proven to reduce ‘cognitive load’ as effectively your brain gets to stop 
            worrying about forgetting to do something in the future and can trust the reminder will
            be there when it is due. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A useful strategy for prioritisation of break in work is the ‘Yes, but…’ approach. Yes 
            I can get that done by Friday, but I’ll have to push out <b>xxx</b>. It’s then a conversation
            around priority than a simple ‘yes/no’ – nobody likes a blunt ‘no’.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Doing your time. As harsh as it seems there is definitely an element of doing your 
            time in the workplace. You will get given some pretty laborious tasks that will 
            make you think - why the hell did I go to college for this? Truth is, there's an
            important element to development in there. You need to do the calculations by hand
            or manually process some data to really understand what it all means. I've done some
            serious excel grunt work in my time - but tell you what, I have some mad skills in
            excel now. To be a master you need to master the basics. Take everything as a learning
            opportunity and approach it with a can do attitude and you'll go a long way.

          <h3 class="sub-headings">Rotations and Development - Breadth vs Depth</h3>
          <p>
            Build depth before breadth. This is one area that if I had my time again I'd do differently.
            I was on a program that rotated me every 1 to 2 years. I did plant engineering, production 
            planning, commercial all within 5 years before moving in to a leadership position. Whilst I 
            know a little about a lot, I don't know a lot about anything. It can kind of make you feel 
            like you’re always in the learning phase and never really across what you’re doing. It also 
            means you don't have a rock solid foundation to always lean back on, so when you tackle the 
            next challenge you at least know that's there supporting you. I'd recommend building depth 
            before looking to build breadth.

          <p>Bring solutions, not problems and a can-do attitude. Don't be afraid to be wrong. </p>
          <p>Be enthusiastic and inquisitive to learn.</p>
          <p>
            View everything as an opportunity. Sometimes you get handed one of those jobs that you just know
            is a hospital-pass. Your approach and response to it will be telling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't be scared to say 'I don't know' - there's nothing more dangerous than the uneducated

            Decisions without facts are gambles. Good decision making is a science in its own right. In the
            short term, good decisions don’t always get good results and sometimes poor decisions get good 
            results. But in the long term, a bad decision making process will always catch you out. That’s 
            why they say to test the decision not the outcome. A bit of a checklist for testing the robustness
            of your decisions (adapted from ‘Making Good Decision's) 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is it that I am deciding?</li>
            <li>Have we looked at the alternatives?</li>
            <li>Do I have all the info I need to make an informed decision?</li>
            <li>Am I clear on values and criteria to base the decision on?  </li>
            <li>Are we thinking straight and applying sound reasoning?</li>
            <li>Are we committed to following through on the decision?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            General rule of thumb, the more complex a decision the more input you’ll want to 
            get from others. For simple decisions, less is more.

      <section id="communication" class="section">
        <div>
          <h3 class="sub-headings">Communication</h3>
          <p>
            There are a lot of smart people out there with fantastic grades, awards, papers etc 
            etc, but what often separates the good from the great is their ability to communicate
            (as Engineers we’re not always the best at communicating!).        
          </p>
          <p>
            I attended a good course called Stand Up, Speak Up and Persuade. Here’s a couple of the
            key takeaways when looking to prepare a presentation, or even an email or important conversation:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Know your audience</b> – ‘what’s in it for me’. Tailor the conversation to the level of detail the person
            is interested in. There’s always the ‘under the hood’ people (peers) that want to know all the details
            like power output, torque, temperatures, pressures etc. There’s the ‘street view’ (supervisors) that are
            interested in things like ‘engine tuning on track’. There’s the helicopter view (managers) that like to
            know the ‘car will be ready to race’ and finally there’s the satellite view (VP / CEO) that really only
            care whether or not we’re going to podium. If you tell the VP / CEO that pressure is down 2% they’ll
            blink at you slowly and then proceed to check their share portfolio.    
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Develop your topic</b>– mind mapping works well. It’s a basic process of writing down the central
            topic in a bubble and then branching out with all the various bits of related information to
            the central topic. The trick is to then identify the key takeaways you want the audience to 
            remember and focus in on those. Structure the presentation around only those, don’t worry
            about all the other detail. In the example above, there’s no point spending 90% of a 
            presentation on next year’s paint scheme to then gloss over the latest gearbox upgrade 
            that could put you on the dais. Tell the audience only what they need to know.    
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Structure up</b> – Opening (‘The Grab’), Body, Conclusion. You’re first 10sec will set the tone for 
            the rest of the presentation, so make it good! A well-structured presentation is critical. Be 
            clear on the key points and limit them to just a few (max three per presentation). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Presentation material. We have a terrible habit of merging the handouts, presentation and report in to
            one epic PowerPoint. This just makes for a boring presentation with limited retention. It does take 
            extra effort to tailor the material but it is well worth it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            And lastly, never read from the slides! If that’s all you’re going to do, send the presentation out for someone to read in their own time.  
          </p>

          <h3 class="sub-headings">Body Language</h3>
          <p>Body language is something to always be mindful of, particularly in meetings. Even where you sit can have an impact.</p>
          <p>
            As a rule of thumb, sitting directly opposite someone can be perceived as a slightly competitive/defensive 
            seating position while sitting next to or adjacent someone (with the desk corner in between) is more collaborative.

            Everyone is different, learns different, thinks different and feels different – that’s the beauty of
            diversity! Being mindful of this is a great start. Being able to spot differences and tailor 
            engagement style that suits is a whole new level. This one you kind of have to learn yourself.

        <div>
          <h3 class="sub-headings">Experts and Managers and if you're lucky… Leaders</h3>
          <p>In general there are two main streams that Engineers head down - there's the technical and there's the managers.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Experts</b> are the technical guys - been around for ages, done it all, know their s#@t inside and out. 
            They're wired for technical details, enjoy problem solving and accumulating knowledge. Often not the
            best communicators and can sometimes struggle with a 'rough enough is good enough' approach or
            business perspective - for these guys science is absolute and everything is black and white. But 
            when you need something Engineered or you're trying to land a mars rover, this is who you want on 
            your side. Work out who the experts are and make them your friend - absorb everything you can from them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Managers</b> - there's a saying that goes something like 'an organisation is like a tree full of monkeys
            - those at the top look down and see smiling faces, those at the bottom look up and see arseholes'.
            Managers get a pretty bad wrap and any reference to 'management' is usually associated with negative
            connotations. Often they're technical experts that have been promoted to managers and no longer have
            time to do the technical work that motivates them because they're too busy managing reports, timesheets
            and development plans. If they're also not the best communicators you may then find their teams don't 
            know what they want, which will eventually result in even more frustration. They often then have to just
            do all the work themselves which eventually leads to burn out. Managers will also have to deal with a 
            bunch of things like lay-offs, budget cuts, process changes, 5 year improvement plans etc which they 
            probably can't talk about with the team but do weigh heavily on the soul (unless they've finally cracked
            and now stark raving mad - I had one of those managers once – one of the nuggets of advice I was given
            was to ‘just take whatever job pays the most’).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Leaders</b> are a bit of a rare bunch. These are people that can align and motivate teams. 
            They're interested in developing their people, have high EQ, can read situations and tailor a 
            response accordingly. We tend to associate them with being charismatic and visionary - the Elon Musk's
            and Richard Branson's of this world - but they're not always the outspoken extroverts, sometimes 
            they're quiet and contemplative. When you find one, buy them a coffee and see if they'll mentor you.
            If they're a leader, they won't say no. You'll have a lot of big decisions you'll need to make through
            your career - these sort of people will be there as sounding boards for when you need them. A good
            mentor won't give you the answer though, but can help you make a good decision.
